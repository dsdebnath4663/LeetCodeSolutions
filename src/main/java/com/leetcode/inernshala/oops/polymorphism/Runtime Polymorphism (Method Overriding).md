Certainly! Here's a task for an intern to practice polymorphism in Java, focusing on method overriding and dynamic method dispatch. This task will involve creating a base class and several subclasses that override a method, then demonstrating polymorphism through these classes.

### Task: Implement a Payment System

#### Objective:
The intern will create a simple payment processing system that uses polymorphism to handle different types of payments (e.g., debit card, credit card, and PayPal).

#### Instructions:

1. **Create a Base Class `Payment`**:
    - Define a method `processPayment(double amount)` that prints a generic payment processing message.

2. **Create Subclasses**:
    - `DebitCardPayment` that extends `Payment`.
    - `CreditCardPayment` that extends `Payment`.
    - `PayPalPayment` that extends `Payment`.

3. **Override the `processPayment` Method**:
    - In each subclass, override the `processPayment(double amount)` method to print a specific message indicating the type of payment being processed.

4. **Demonstrate Polymorphism**:
    - In a `main` method, create an array or list of `Payment` references that includes instances of `DebitCardPayment`, `CreditCardPayment`, and `PayPalPayment`.
    - Iterate through the array or list and call `processPayment` on each element, demonstrating that the correct method for each payment type is called.


Sure, I can help you create a UML diagram for the payment processing system described in the task. The diagram will include the base class `Payment` and the subclasses `DebitCardPayment`, `CreditCardPayment`, and `PayPalPayment`, showing the method `processPayment` and how it is overridden in each subclass.

### Explanation

1. **Payment Class**:
    - **Attributes**: None specified for this example.
    - **Methods**:
        - `void processPayment(double amount)`: A method that prints a generic payment processing message.

2. **DebitCardPayment Class** (inherits from `Payment`):
    - **Methods**:
        - Overrides `processPayment(double amount)` to provide a specific message for debit card payments.

3. **CreditCardPayment Class** (inherits from `Payment`):
    - **Methods**:
        - Overrides `processPayment(double amount)` to provide a specific message for credit card payments.

4. **PayPalPayment Class** (inherits from `Payment`):
    - **Methods**:
        - Overrides `processPayment(double amount)` to provide a specific message for PayPal payments.

+---------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
| + processPayment(amount: double) | + processPayment(amount: double) | + processPayment(amount: double) |
+---------------------------+---------------------+----------------------+
```

This UML class diagram illustrates the relationships and methods involved in the payment processing system. It shows how the `Payment` base class is extended by three subclasses, each overriding the `processPayment` method to provide specific behavior for different types of payments.
