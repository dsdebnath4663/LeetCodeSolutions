### Explanation:

1. **Classes and Interfaces**:
    - **Person**: The base class with attributes `name` and `age` and a method `displayPersonDetails`.
    - **Employee**: A subclass of `Person` with an additional attribute `salary` and a method `displayEmployeeDetails`.
    - **Manager**: A subclass of `Employee` that implements both `Payable` and `Promotable` interfaces.
    - **Developer**: A subclass of `Employee` that implements the `Payable` interface.

2. **Interfaces**:
    - **Payable**: Interface with the method `processPayment`.
    - **Promotable**: Interface with the method `promote`.

3. **Methods**:
    - `displayPersonDetails()`: Displays the name and age of the person.
    - `displayEmployeeDetails()`: Displays the name, age, and salary of the employee.
    - `processPayment()`: Processes the payment (implemented in both `Manager` and `Developer`).
    - `promote()`: Promotes the employee (implemented in `Manager`).
    - `conductMeeting()`: Conducts a meeting (specific to `Manager`).
    - `writeCode()`: Writes code (specific to `Developer`).

This UML diagram visually represents the relationship between the base class `Person`, the derived class `Employee`, and the interfaces `Payable` and `Promotable` as implemented by `Manager` and `Developer`.
